# Project-Etch-a-Sketch

This is my second javascript project from scratch, I will be attempting to create an etch-a-sketch like tool. This README will be updated as I progress.

I took a long break in the middle of this project. When I returned I felt slightly overwhelmed with what I'd created, so I decided to start from scratch. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of re-learning most of the code featured here and I honestly loved making the project. 

For the future I'd like to look in CSS design that scales with mobile screens. I feel like my style is very basic, but I wanted to focus on functionality first and foremost. 
I also want to look into more advanced CSS, I sort a lot of beautiful styles I avoided including as I wasn't fully sure how they worked.
